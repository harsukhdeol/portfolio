          <p class="description">
            I had the the oppourtunity to work on front-end development and
            ux/ui design projects during my workterm at Thomson Reuters.
            Overall, I took a product from the user research phase all the way
            to the deployment phase.I created user discussion guides, conducted
            interviews and created wireframes. I then took these wireframes and
            built the app with React. Once the frontend was complete, I
            connected it to internal servers with async fetch requests to the
            REST API. Once that project was complete, I focused on designing
            mockups for a new initiative that the company was taking on. I also
            created company assets and communicated with stakeholders to design
            a new feature in an internal application.

              I used Dynamo to automate the creation of routine engineering
              drawings used in HVAC and electrical systems of all buildings.
              Dynamo is a visual programming language based off Python that uses
              Revit API to automate drafting and engineering calculations. Below
              is a sample of the tasks I automated with this program.
