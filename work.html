            I had the the oppourtunity to work on front-end development and
            ux/ui design projects during my workterm at Thomson Reuters.
            Overall, I took a product from the user research phase all the way
            to the deployment phase.I created user discussion guides, conducted
            interviews and created wireframes. I then took these wireframes and
            built the app with React. Once the frontend was complete, I
            connected it to internal servers with async fetch requests to the
            REST API. Once that project was complete, I focused on designing
            mockups for a new initiative that the company was taking on. I also
            created company assets and communicated with stakeholders to design
            a new feature in an internal application.

            <h3>PII Obfuscation APP</h3>
            <p>
              The first project I worked on was on the UI design and front-end
              development of the PII Obfuscation App. The Personally
              Identifiable Information (PII) Obfuscation App cleans personal
              information from documents, so the data can be leveraged for
              machine learning and AI purposes while ensuring that the highest
              standard of personal information removal is met. I created a
              discussion guide and conducted a user interview to design
              wireframes. Once I validated the wireframes, I developed the
              frontend app with React and connected it to the backend as well.
              This was one of the more technical projects I contributed to,
              where I learned more about React, REST APIs and asynchronous
              programming.

            <h3>AI Everywhere Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              I designed the learning and homepages for a new initiative on the
              main company website. I worked with the feedback received from the
              user research and created designs to reflect it. I reviewed my
              designs with several members of the team and communicated my ideas
              to stakeholders and TR employees, that I would normally not have
              the opportunity to connect with. This was around the time when the
              quarantine started, so every bit of human interaction was
              appreciated! This project really worked my creative muscle as I
              had to design wireframes that included all the features that users
              had requested while keeping it engaging, easy to follow and
              reflective of the native Hub experience.

            <h3>Designing feature of an app for Legal Professionals</h3>
            <p>
              I created wireframes to include a status feature on each task that
              pointed out errors to help users review invoices more efficiently.
              In this project, I worked on developing my UX skills by doing
              research to understand the user and what actions they would take.
              With the help of @corey_oullette, I learned how to create user
              experience that was logical and effective to complete the task at
              hand. I also had the opportunity to present my designs to
              stakeholders to gain a better understanding of which features will
              be useful to them. With this information, I created discussion
              guide to conduct user interviews for the mockups.

              I contributed to the design of the logo of the new worked on the
              project decision tree document that guides the reader through a
              series of questions to help them decide if their idea is feasible
              for TR Labs. I redesigned the document to something that was easy
              to follow and aesthetically pleasing. I also redesigned the TR
              Labs newsletter with Annie to reflect the current TR Labs
              branding. We created a new template in Word, which could be easily
              modified and updated by both technical and non-technical
              professionals
